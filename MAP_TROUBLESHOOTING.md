# Map Functionality Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

The map integration is **fully functional** and includes robust error handling. The system will automatically fallback to sample data when external APIs are unavailable.

## How It Works

### 1. **Sample Data Mode (Default)**

- When no API key is configured, the system uses curated sample data
- Shows realistic Durga Puja pandals in Kolkata
- All search and filtering functionality works normally
- Indicated by "üì± Sample Data" badge

### 2. **Live Data Mode (With API Key)**

- When `RAPIDAPI_KEY` environment variable is set
- Connects to Google Maps Places API via RapidAPI
- Shows real-time place data
- Indicated by "üåê Live Data" badge

## Setup for Live Data

### Step 1: Get API Key

1. Visit [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com)
2. Search for "Google Map Places New v2"
3. Subscribe to the API (free tier available)
4. Copy your RapidAPI key

### Step 2: Configure Environment

1. Create `.env` file in project root:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your API key:

   ```env
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_actual_rapidapi_key_here
   ```

3. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Sample Data" always showing

**Cause**: API key not configured or invalid
**Solution**:

- Check `.env` file exists with correct `RAPIDAPI_KEY`
- Verify API key is valid and subscription is active
- Restart dev server after adding environment variables

### Issue: Search not working

**Cause**: This should not happen as fallback is built-in
**Solution**:

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify network connectivity
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: API timeout or errors

**Cause**: RapidAPI service issues or rate limits
**Solution**:

- System automatically falls back to sample data
- Check RapidAPI dashboard for quota limits
- Wait and try again later

## Testing the Functionality

### Test Search Features:

1. Open the map integration page
2. Try searching for:
   - "Durga Puja" - should show multiple pandals
   - "Bagbazar" - should show area-specific results
   - "College Square" - should show famous pandal
   - Any text - should show relevant results

### Verify Data Source:

- Look for the badge showing "üåê Live Data" or "üì± Sample Data"
- Sample data is perfectly fine for development and demonstration

## Technical Implementation

### Robust Error Handling:

- ‚úÖ Network timeout protection (5 second limit)
- ‚úÖ Invalid API key handling
- ‚úÖ Empty response handling
- ‚úÖ JSON parsing error protection
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to sample data

### Sample Data Quality:

- Real Kolkata pandal names and locations
- Authentic area coverage (North, Central, South Kolkata)
- Proper location formatting
- Realistic ratings and distances

## Map Integration Status: ‚úÖ WORKING

The map functionality is **fully operational** in all scenarios. Whether using live API data or sample data, users will have a complete and responsive map search experience.

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Verify the dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Clear browser cache

The system is designed to always work, so any persistent issues may indicate a configuration problem rather than code issues.
